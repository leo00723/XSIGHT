          <p>We understand that your privacy while using our Site is important, especially when conducting business or
            providing
            sensitive personal information. This notice will govern our Privacy Policy for users of this or any other
            Jestalt website, whether or not a transaction of any sort is conducted while visiting.</p>


          <h3>Your Personal Information</h3>

          <p>The information we learn from customers helps us to personalise and continually improve our customer
            service, while developing ways to improve your experience at Jestalt. Following is some of the
            information we gather about our users.</p>


          <p>Information You Provide Us: <br />

            When you complete a Customer Profile or other form online or communicate with us via e-mail, letter or
            phone, we receive and store the information you’ve provided. This information is basic, including: name,
            addresses, phone and cell phone numbers, e-mail address, interests and business information (if applicable).
            We use this information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, communicating
            with
            you and customising future services for you.</p>


          <p>Third Party Vendors: <br />

            In addition to collecting your information, we may have third party vendors who will also collect your
            information in order to provide the products and/or services you’ve requested (e.g. credit card companies
            or banks, fulfilment companies, call centres, suppliers, affiliates and marketing companies). In general,
            these companies are intermediaries acting solely to provide services related to your request. Most of these
            vendors have their own privacy policy to protect your information, and have access to personal information
            needed to perform their functions on behalf of Jestalt, but may not use the same for other purposes.</p>


          <p>Are Cookies Used By Jestalt: <br />

            browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser. We can see what pages you click through,
            plus store items in your Shopping Cart between visits. The ‘Help’ portion of the toolbar on most
            browsers will instruct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the
            browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and/or how to disable cookies altogether. Please
            note that disabling cookies will prevent you from using many of our services.</p>

            and for the purposes set out above.</p>

          <p>Information from other sources: <br />

            We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.
            Examples may include, but not be limited to, updated delivery and address information from our carriers or
            other
            third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more
            easily;
            account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from some merchants with
            which
            we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfilment, advertising, or other
            services;
            search term and search result information from some searches conducted through the Web search features
            offered
            by certain organisations; search results and links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and
            credit
            history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain
            credit or financial services to some customers, and information from data providers.</p>

           
          <h3>Does Jestalt Share the Information It Receives?</h3>

          <p>Simply said, no. Under no circumstances will we ever give away or sell your personal information to anyone
            else for any reason whatsoever, without prior written approval from yourself. Any information we gain
            through
            our use of customer polls, surveys, cookies, session tracking or anything else, is used internally and for
            the sole purpose of providing you better service. If you are on our mailing list and you ask us to remove
            you,
            we will immediately and will not attempt to sell on your information. As we do with our own, we respect
            your privacy.</p>

          <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of
            selling it to other companies. We share customer information only as described in this statement and with
            subsidiaries of Jestalt with controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow the practice
            at least as protective as that described in this Notice.</p>
           

          <h3>How Secure Is The Information About Me?</h3>

          <p>All of our employees and partners are familiar with our security policy and practices. Your personal
            information is only accessible to a limited number of qualified people who are given a password in order
            to gain access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis.
            Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption
            protocols, in place to protect information sent over the Internet.</p>

          <p>While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications and
            databases are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such
            events will not take place and we will not be liable for any such occurrences. You will find that almost
            all Internet e-commerce providers make this same claim, especially if they use privacy policy templates
            such as this one to make known their company or organisation privacy policies.</p>

          <p>Where possible, we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.
            Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order
            processing. Protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer by signing off when
            you
            finish using a computer.</p>

           
          <h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>

          <p>As discussed above, you always have the choice not to provide information, even though it might be needed
            to
            make a purchase with Jestalt. You can add or update certain information on your Personal Jestalt pages at
            any
            time. If you do not want to receive e-mails or other mail from us, simply click the Preferences link at the
            footer of any email sent by Jestalt and you will be removed from our mailing list. To remove other personal
            information from Jestalt, please contact our offices. Please note that you cannot opt-out of communication
            pertaining to services such as making a purchase on Jestalt.</p>

           
          <h3>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>

          <p>If you choose to visit Jestalt, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our
            Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the laws of
            the Republic of South Africa. If you have any concern about privacy at our site, please contact us with a
            thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>

          <p>Because our business changes constantly, our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We
            may
            e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you
            should check our Web Site frequently to see recent changes.</p>

          <p>Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and
            your
            account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and
            practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of
            affected customers.</p>

          <p>Jestalt may feature public forums where users with similar interests can share information and support one
            another
            or where users can post questions. Our communities are open to the public and should not be considered
            private.</p>

          <p>Any information you share in any online community area is by design open to the public and is not private.
            You should think carefully before posting any personal information in any public forum. What you post can be
            seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or
            predict,
            including to contact you for unauthorised purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information
            you
            post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, Bing etc.</p>

           
          <h3>Consumer Protection Act (CPA)</h3>

          <p>South African CPA laws shall supersede any Jestalt terms and conditions which conflict with the act or any
            other
            laws in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

            <p>Jestalt is currently in a state of change. We are using our skills and backgrounds in architecture,
              visualization, and the property sales market, to develop interactive tools to revitalise the off-plan
              property market.<br /></p>
            <p>We are looking for property related industry professionals to connect with. Our goals are to discuss our
              platform in conjunction with your business, sharing knowledge of our experiences from within different
              parts of the industry, and talk broadly on where we believe it is headed.<br /></p>
            <p>Through these discussions we hope to develop a keen perspective on the property market in both South
              Africa & the United Kingdom. To assess what opportunities may lie within the sector, and what key
              opportunities our new platform can look to provide solutions for.<br /></p>
            <p>We are also looking for the right investment partners. If you are interested in meeting with us to
              discuss our solutions for the PropTech space please get in touch.</p>
