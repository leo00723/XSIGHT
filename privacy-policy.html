                    <p>Information You Provide Us: <br/>
                    
                    When you complete a Customer Profile or other form online or communicate with us via e-mail, letter or 
                    phone, we receive and store the information you’ve provided. This information is basic, including: name, 
                    addresses, phone and cell phone numbers, e-mail address, interests and business information (if applicable). 
                    We use this information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, communicating with 
                    you and customising future services for you.</p>

                    In addition to collecting your information, we may have third party vendors who will also collect your 
                    information in order to provide the products and/or services you’ve requested (e.g. credit card companies 
                    or banks, fulfilment companies, call centres, suppliers, affiliates and marketing companies). In general, 
                    these companies are intermediaries acting solely to provide services related to your request. Most of these 
                    vendors have their own privacy policy to protect your information, and have access to personal information 
                    needed to perform their functions on behalf of Jestalt, but may not use the same for other purposes.</p>

                    We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. 
                    Examples may include, but not be limited to, updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other 
                    third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily;
                    account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from some merchants with which 
                    we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfilment, advertising, or other services; 
                    search term and search result information from some searches conducted through the Web search features offered 
                    by certain organisations; search results and links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and credit 
                    history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain 
                    credit or financial services to some customers, and information from data providers.</p>
                    
                     
                    <h3>Does Jestalt Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
                    
                    <p>Simply said, no. Under no circumstances will we ever give away or sell your personal information to anyone 
                        else for any reason whatsoever, without prior written approval from yourself. Any information we gain through 
                        our use of customer polls, surveys, cookies, session tracking or anything else, is used internally and for
                        the sole purpose of providing you better service. If you are on our mailing list and you ask us to remove you, 
                        we will immediately and will not attempt to sell on your information. As we do with our own, we respect 
                        your privacy.</p>
                    
                    <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of 
                        selling it to other companies. We share customer information only as described in this statement and with 
                        subsidiaries of Jestalt with controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow the practice 
                        at least as protective as that described in this Notice.</p>
                     
                    
                    <h3>How Secure Is The Information About Me?</h3>
                    
                    <p>All of our employees and partners are familiar with our security policy and practices. Your personal 
                        information is only accessible to a limited number of qualified people who are given a password in order 
                        to gain access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis. 
                        Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption 
                        protocols, in place to protect information sent over the Internet.</p>
                    
                    <p>While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications and 
                        databases are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such 
                        events will not take place and we will not be liable for any such occurrences. You will find that almost 
                        all Internet e-commerce providers make this same claim, especially if they use privacy policy templates 
                        such as this one to make known their company or organisation privacy policies.</p>
                    
                    <p>Where possible, we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. 
                        Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order 
                        processing. Protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer by signing off when you 
                        finish using a computer.</p>
                    
                     
                    <h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
                    
                    <p>As discussed above, you always have the choice not to provide information, even though it might be needed to 
                        make a purchase with Jestalt. You can add or update certain information on your Personal Jestalt pages at any 
                        time. If you do not want to receive e-mails or other mail from us, simply click the Preferences link at the 
                        footer of any email sent by Jestalt and you will be removed from our mailing list. To remove other personal 
                        information from Jestalt, please contact our offices. Please note that you cannot opt-out of communication 
                        pertaining to services such as making a purchase on Jestalt.</p>
                    
                     
                    <h3>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>
                    
                    <p>If you choose to visit Jestalt, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our 
                        Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the laws of 
                        the Republic of South Africa. If you have any concern about privacy at our site, please contact us with a 
                        thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Because our business changes constantly, our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may 
                        e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you 
                        should check our Web Site frequently to see recent changes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your 
                        account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and 
                        practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of 
                        affected customers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Jestalt may feature public forums where users with similar interests can share information and support one another 
                        or where users can post questions. Our communities are open to the public and should not be considered private.</p>
                    
                    <p>Any information you share in any online community area is by design open to the public and is not private. 
                        You should think carefully before posting any personal information in any public forum. What you post can be 
                        seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, 
                        including to contact you for unauthorised purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information you 
                        post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, Bing etc.</p>
                    
                     
                    <h3>Consumer Protection Act (CPA)</h3>
                    
                    <p>South African CPA laws shall supersede any Jestalt terms and conditions which conflict with the act or any other 
                        laws in the Republic of South Africa.</p>
