						<strong> Google likes content</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Yep, the Google gods are all about quality content.

						Don’t believe me? Just head over to YouTube and look up interviews with Matt Cutts (the former
						head of
						webspam
						at Google). You’ll be hard pressed to find him to respond to a question about how to rank higher
						in Google
						with anything other than “write great content.”

						Google is obsessed with providing their users with the search experiences that deliver what
						they’re looking
						for. High-quality content is often the best way to provide that experience.

						Ok, so Google likes content. Who cares?


						Short answer: Everyone.
						A 2018 study from SparkToro found that Google sends 10x more traffic to the average website than
						Facebook
						(and
						more than 10x for any other website).

						In other words, content marketing dramatically boosts website traffic from your most effective
						traffic
						channel
						(organic search).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2 class="">
						<strong> Content marketing drives more sales</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Boosting website traffic is meaningless if it doesn’t result in more sales.

						Don’t worry: content marketing helps drive more sales too.

						Most of your customers won’t be ready to buy from you the first time that they hear about your
						business.
						People go through a buying process before committing to a purchase. With smaller products (ex. a
						pack of
						gum), this buying process is quick; with larger products (ex. a new car), this process takes
						much longer.

						We’re going to take an image from our friends at HubSpot about the inbound marketing methodology
						to help
						demonstrate.

						Before making a purchase, people realize that they have a problem that needs solving
						(awareness). They take
						time to research and better understand their problem (consideration). Then, they make a decision
						on which
						solution is best for them (decision).

						A fully constructed content marketing system helps your potential customers during all 3 of
						these stages by
						educating them on what they’re searching for.

						Content marketing, therefore, helps you by:

						Bringing your potential customers 1 step closer to making a purchase.
						Building a relationship with your target audience to make them more likely to work with your
						business,
						instead of your competitors.
						If that’s not enough, inbound leads (i.e. leads from online marketing) have a 14.6% conversion
						rate, while
						outbound leads (leads from cold calling, direct mail, etc.) have a 1.7% close rate.

						Why is content marketing so important? Content marketing drives more sales.

					<h2 class="">
						<strong> …And helps put sales on autopilot</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Cold sales outreach is hard as hell.

						I know because that’s where 50% of my time went for my first three months of doing Inter full
						time.
						As you may have guessed based on the number of responses, it didn’t go very well.

						People are busy, and none of those people were searching for marketing services.

						The result: a lot of disappointment. I ended up wasting a lot of time and money on campaigns
						that failed to
						drive any ROI for Inter.

						Around March 2017, we stopped doing cold outreach entirely. Instead, we decided to focus on
						digital
						marketing, with the majority of our efforts being put towards content marketing.

						Today, potential partners reach out to us when they’re ready to work with us. We have a
						conversation about
						their goals, identify the right approach to help them grow, and see if we’re the right team for
						them to
						partner with. In some cases we are; in other cases we aren’t. Either way, we help each of those
						potential
						partners to find the right solution to help them grow.

						Content marketing helps transition sales from forcing a customer to buy your product to being a
						valuable
						resource that is there when your customers are ready to buy from you. Click to Tweet this.

					<h2 class="">
						<strong> Content marketing lets you control the conversation</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						It’s no secret that selling a product becomes much easier when your customer is looking for what
						you sell.

						Let’s say you sell high-end sofas. Someone on the hunt for a $300 sofa isn’t going to be easy to
						sell to. By
						the time they walk into your store, they’ve already made up their mind about what type of sofa
						they need.

						However, what if you could talk to that person while they were researching sofas? What if you
						could talk to
						them about the importance of paying a premium for quality before they made up their mind about
						how much they
						were going to spend?

						Controlling the conversation while your most likely customers are educating themselves is
						invaluable. The
						same holds true for everything from car insurance to business software.

						So why not write about these conversation points? Why not control the conversation when your
						customers are
						deciding what they need? Chances are your competitors are beating you to the punch and stealing
						your best
						potential customers.

						<strong> It’s way less annoying than traditional marketing</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Nobody likes being interrupted in the middle of their day by people trying to sell them
						something.
						40% of internet users already use ad blockers, and that number isn’t going to decrease over
						time.

						Sure, banner ads can be a good way to showcase your brand. But spending money on TV commercials
						and other
						forms of advertising that interrupt your customers doesn’t sound like the best way to win them
						over.

						Content marketing, on the other hand, enables you to build customer relationships by putting
						your brand in
						front of your customers in a way that helps them. Click to Tweet this.

						So why are you still paying hundreds of dollars for a 30-second TV commercial? Content marketing
						costs way
						less (and is way more effective). Talk to us instead.

						<strong> Content marketing amplifies your brand awareness</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Let’s say you run an investment firm and decide to write an informative article that ranks 1st
						on Google for
						“how to invest in stocks.”

						40,000+ people search for that exact phrase on Google every month. You’ve now put your brand in
						front of
						480,000 potential customers every year.

						And that’s just for the exact phrase “how to invest in stocks.” There are an additional 40,000
						people who
						search for the exact phrase “how to buy stocks” every month on top of that, not to mention the
						other close
						variants. At least 1 million people search for this theme every year. Click to Tweet this.

						Also see: avoid these 7 content marketing mistakes at all costs.

				<div>
					<h2 class="">
						<strong>…And the credibility of your brand</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						So your investing article now appears in front of 1+ million potential customers every year. Out
						of that
						number, ~25% of people will click on your article.

						Assuming you put time into making the article helpful to your readers, 250,000 people will now
						view your
						brand as a thought leader and credible information source every year. Many of those people will
						go on to
						become your customers over time or tell a friend about your website and turn their friend into a
						customer.

						Why is content marketing so important? Content marketing amplifies the credibility of your
						brand.

						<strong>Content marketing provides compounding ROI</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Let’s assume you decide to write a second article about the best dividend stocks.

						Over time, you rank 1st on Google for “best dividend stocks,” which is searched for 22,000 times
						every
						month. You’ve now put your brand in front of an additional 260,000 people every year, which
						results in an
						additional 65,000 qualified website visitors every year.

						Now your website went from 250,000 annual visitors to 300,000.

						Each additional article has the potential to significantly increase your qualified website
						visitors each
						month. To add to this, other websites link to helpful information sources. Each of these links
						helps to
						drive more qualified website visitors to the article that is linked to, as well as the other
						pages on your
						site.

						<strong>Content marketing grows your social media following</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Each potential customer that finds valuable content on your site becomes a potential advocate
						for your
						brand.

						Many of these readers will follow you on Facebook or Twitter so they can stay up to date on
						future articles
						that you write. Many of these readers will also share your articles with their friends and
						family on social
						media, which helps to exponentially grow your following over time.

						Why is content marketing so important? Content marketing grows your social media following.

					<h2 class="">
						<strong>Content marketing drives more visibility to your product pages</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Content marketing, directly and indirectly, drives significantly more people to your product
						pages.

						Directly:
						Assuming you write articles that relate to what you sell, many of those readers will go on to
						visit your
						product pages after reading your articles (especially if your articles link out to those product
						pages).

						Indirectly:
						When you write kickass blog content, other websites link back to that content.

						Search engines look at each new backlink as a testimonial that your article is a useful
						resource. And each
						page that your article links to is seen as a more helpful resource as well.

						So that blog article that links to your product page sends a little love to your product page
						each time that
						someone links to that article.

						The more love that you send to your product pages, the more likely you are to rank 1st on Google
						when your
						customers are ready to buy from you. For example, if your home insurance page gets enough links
						from your
						blog, it can start to rank for “home insurance services.” Click to Tweet this.

						Still not sold? See how we helped a camera backpack company to rank 7th on Google for “camera
						backpacks”
						right before the holidays in this e-commerce SEO case study.

						<strong>Content marketing makes life WAY easier for your customer service team</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Does your customer service team answer the same questions every day?

						Whether it’s how to reset your password or how to use your product, take the time to write an
						informative
						answer to those questions. Compile those into a blog post or series of blog posts that your
						customer service
						team can share when they do get those regular questions.

						Many customers will even find these answers through an online search instead of reaching out to
						your
						customer service team, to begin with.
						Why is content marketing so important? Content marketing makes life WAY easier for your customer
						service
						team.

				</div>
				<div>
					<h2 class="">
						<strong>…as well as your sales team</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						Now reach out to your sales team and ask them which questions they get on a daily basis. Write
						useful
						content about these common sales questions/concerns that prospects ask.

						Now hand those articles to your sales team. Ask them to enhance these articles based on what
						they see
						driving the best results for your team.

						Congratulations. Your website just became your new best salesperson (and it works for you 24/7).

						<strong>Content marketing scales your retargeting audience</strong>
						<hr style="width:100%; border-top: 1px solid #facb4f;">
					</h2>
					<p class="">
						One of the most effective marketing strategies for e-commerce companies is to set up display ads
						of their
						products to those who visit their product pages, yet leave the site before purchasing a product.

						Ok, call me a hypocrite for adding this point after bashing TV ads. However, finding people who
						express
						interest in one of your products and reminding them about those products does provide value.

						Content marketers can take the same approach.

						Let’s say you write an article about the top 5 questions to ask before buying a new mattress.
						Those who take
						the time to read the article are very likely to buy a new mattress in the upcoming months. So
						why not set up
						display ads of some of your top mattresses for those readers?
