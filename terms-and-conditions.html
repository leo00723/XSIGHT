                        choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on contracts for the international sale of goods. You agree 
                        that jurisdiction over and venue in any legal proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this site 
                        (including but not limited to the purchase of Jestalt products) shall be in the Province where Jestalt’s head offices are 
                        located. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the site (including but not limited to the purchase of Jestalt’s products or services)

                        practice shall act to modify any of these terms and conditions. Jestalt may assign its rights and duties under this 
                        Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.</p>

                    <p>The Jestalt site and all content are provided on an “as is” basis. The contents of the site, such as text, graphics, images, 
                        information obtained from Jestalt’s licensors, and other material contained on the Jestalt site (“Content”) are for 
                        informational purposes only and do not constitute advice. The user is encouraged to consult with a professional advisor 
                        before acting on any information or content appearing on or transmitted through Jestalt’s web site. Nothing on the site shall

                    <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>
                    
                    <p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Jestalt may link to sites operated by third parties. However, 
                        even if the third party is affiliated with Jestalt, Jestalt has no control over these linked sites, all of which have 
                        separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Jestalt. These linked sites are only for your convenience and 
                        therefore you access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, Jestalt seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links
                         placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including 
                         if a specific link does not work).</p>

                    <p>You agree that you will not upload or transmit any communications or content of any type to any public areas that infringe 
                        or violate any rights of any party. By submitting communications or content to Jestalt, you agree that such submission is 
                        non-confidential for all purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you make any submission to a public area or if you submit any business information, idea, concept or invention to Jestalt 
                        by email, you automatically grant-or warrant that the owner of such content or intellectual property has expressly granted

                        or any form, format, or forum now known or hereafter developed. If you wish to keep any business information, ideas, concepts
                         or inventions private or proprietary, do not submit them to the site or to Jestalt by email. We try to answer every email 
                         in a timely manner, but are not always able to do so.</p>
